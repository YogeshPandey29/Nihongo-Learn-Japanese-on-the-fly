# NIHONGO-Learn Japanese on the fly

## About

A simple yet beautifully designed application to facilitate users to come across the basic linguistic aspects of the Japanese language. Learning a new language could be benficical
to a person in many different ways. It could induce a feeling of respect and gratitude towards the nation and the people. A person might come across different traditions and cultures that he never knew of, and could embrace them like a resident of the nation.

At the same time, a person could become close and establish friendly relations with the local people and the localites also see it as a token of respect and begin to consider the peron as one of their own. Learning a new language greatly expands your linguistic boundaries and hence makes you socially and emotionally connected to the nation.

Keeping this thought in mind, I started this project wherein I have designed an Android application to let the users learn the basic words and phrases used in the Japanese linguistic dictionary, and would definitely prove useful to a person while communicating and hence establishing a genuine connection with the listener.

## App's architecture and working

The application features a list on the main menu from where a user can navigate to various screens/activities in the app, and can access the content on various pages. The pages contain an assorted collection of basic phrases and words that are used regularly in the Japanese vocabulary. For an instance, to know the various greeting phrases, and words, the numbers and family members, and things like the most famous tourist attractions in whole of Japan.

## Accessibility and User Experience

In this project, the aspects upon which I have focused the most are the UX viewpoints while giving a smooth and seamless experience all the same. The core android technologies that I have used to make the backend architecture of the application more smooth and versatile are: Customized ArrayAdapters, Mediaplayer API, AudioFocus API, AsyncTask and AsyncTaskLoaders and a few more to make this app provide a smooth user experience.
